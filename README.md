## Overview

This is a pokedex made with Vanilla Javascript, Boostrap, CSS and HTML5. It is
fully responsive and adjustable to most modern devices. It has a search
functionality that allows to search by name, and type of the pokemon. It has
several pages all from each generation. Also all pokemon have a modal that you
can learn more about their stats.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen
    size
-   Search for specfic Pokemon they choose to

### Built with

-   Boostrap
-   CSS custom properties
-   Javascript

### What I learned

I learned how to fetch data using API calls which I then manipulated the data to
the user interface. I learned how to convert objects and arrays to one another
and then use array methods on data. I learned more about mobile responsive with
Boostrap.

### Continued development

My main improvement would be to just use more best practice javascript so what I
mean is learn more about loops, Using different array methods to loop over
things instead of just making just a basic loop.
